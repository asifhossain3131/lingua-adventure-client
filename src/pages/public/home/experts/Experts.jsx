            There are tangible benefits to being bilingualâ€”it can improve your
            brain and memory functions, boost your creativity and self-esteem,
            help in your career opportunities, as well as increase your
            understanding of the language you already speak. <br /> Knowing the same language connects us to one another. We use language to share information, thoughts, and ideas, and these viewpoints collectively create culture. Learning a second language connects you to a whole new group of people and their culture.
